<h2>About</h2>
<!--Please ignore the poor indentation.-->
<p>
SamplerCh. is a simple, open source & free music production software. This software allows you to "chop" up audio files and turn them into "samples"--samples which you can assign to a 4x4 grid of "pads" that can be played with the click of a mouse/press of a key. You then can record & sequence your preformances on the pads, allowing you to create songs; treat this software like an instrument, or in the words of Roger Linn: <em>"-think of it as the piano or violin of our time"</em>.
</p>
<p>
⠀⠀The software interface & functions are inspired by the classic AKAI MPC 2000 because I saw how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z73CcodfT_w&ab_channel=equiknockz">simple it was to create music on that machine</a> (not to undermine Pete), & sick of trying to figure out DAWs I decided I would make this software based on the MPC's easy work flow. How I want to "cook" is to be able to open the software, load my samples & begin; no confusion that leads me to closing the software along with my creative inspiration.
</p>
<p>
With this freeware, I hope to bring My & Linn's ideas about simplified music production to the digital environment.

TLDR; My Mission: <strong><em>Anyone Can Cook!</em></strong>

<h2>Apology for Potential Contributers</h2>
<p>This is programmed in 100% Python using the tkinter gui library. This project <strong>used</strong> to be created using an object oriented means: every object or component of the software is separated into it's own file then rendered into the main file; I'm very sad I had to abandon this approach, as I was proud of it. But as the notice in <code>ch.py</code> states, "I wasn't able to implement as much functions as I wanted to"--thus--all the code is in one file (<code>ch.py</code>) So, if anyone wants to fork this or contribute which I highly doubt, I am sorry.</p>
